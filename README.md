The file title "static flotsam pages" is a windows rar file that is currently hosted on the dreamhost server and is accessible via the url palyflotsam.com. The pages are locked and not for public viewing .For authorization access contact the AIL CTO, Abe or the Director, Erin.
The file contains all the static html pages required. A single stylesheet is used for styling all the pages.
A small script tag is embedded onto each of the pages that ensure that the pages are accessed by authorized personnel only. 
The stylesheet uses several "ids". It divides the page into 3 sections : left(left sidebar), main section and right sidebar.
It uses layered backgrounds of CSS3 allowing interlaeaving of multiple layers of background.

The file titled "flotsam WP backup" is a windows rar file that holds the backup of the Wordpress pages for Playflotsam.com.It was created between October 2012-December 2012. 
The wordpress parent theme on this backup is a "Twenty-twelve" theme. A chil theme was subsequently created by me. The child theme is named "Child of 2012- Flotsam & Jetsam". It's sample page "welcome#1" sources images from the folder "samples" under "playflotsam.com". It has all the core features of the parent theme. 
But it has been tweaked. There is no "comments" or "leave a reply"section.It has a customized left and right sidebar with a special section for embedding youtube videos.

The file titled "flotsam old WP backup" is a windows rar file that holds the backup of the Wordpress pages for flotsam.com.It was overwritten in October 2012.
